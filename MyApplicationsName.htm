    <!-- 
        The story in spoken words:

        Involved are 6 files:
        1. MyApplicationsName.htm
        2. mvc/model/MyApplicationsName.js
        3. mvc/model/model1.json
        4. mvc/controller/FirstClass.js
        5. mvc/controller/SecondClass.js
        6. mvc/controller/my-example-php-file.php

        This set of 6 files, represent a template 
        with best practices for setting up a clean application from the scratch. 
        The given structure follows the MVC-pattern (Model-View-Controller)
        and the module-pattern.

        The MODEL:
        the center of the "model"-part, is the file "mvc/model/MyApplicationsName.js",
        where all the needed configurations/settings of the application
        and the retrieved JSON-files and datbase-content should be placed.

        The VIEW:
        the "view"-part, is the DOM in this file (MyApplicationsName.htm)
        and would be additionaly the CSS-files (here not included)

        The CONTROLLER:
        the "controller"-part are the rest of the files:
        "mvc/controller/FirstClass.js", "mvc/controller/SecondClass.js" and "mvc/controller/my-example-php-file.php"
        and all other classes which would be added as needed.
        Note: Every class is a file, is a module.

    <!-- The DOM-elements (plus CSS and IMG) represent the VIEW -->

    <!-- The CENTER for Configuration and Model (JSONs) must be included first. -->
    <script src="mvc/model/MyApplicationsName.js?since=202309150721&revision=121"></script>

    <!-- The Classes / Modules. The order of inclusion doesnt matter. -->
